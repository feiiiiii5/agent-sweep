      - Sidecars: files listed in `sidecars` (a SQLite database's `-wal` and
        `-shm`) are backed up alongside `path` and deleted once the replace
        lands. The caller MUST only pass sidecars whose committed contents
        are already folded into `new_content` — for SQLite that is what
        `Connection.backup()` does. Deleting them is what makes the
        redaction stick: a `-wal` left beside a replaced database still
        holds the pre-redaction plaintext, and SQLite replays it over the
        new file on the next open, silently restoring the secret.
      - Post-write validation (str content), selected by `fmt`:
          "jsonl" — every non-empty line must parse as JSON and the line
                    count must match the original (the default);
          "json"  — the whole content must parse as one JSON document
                    (re-serialization may legitimately reflow lines, so no
                    line-count check);
          "text"  — the line count must match the original (markdown and
                    plaintext histories, where redaction replaces whole
                    lines 1:1).
        bytes content is the contract for binary formats (SQLite), where
        these checks are meaningless — the producing source MUST validate
        the bytes itself (e.g. PRAGMA integrity_check on the rewritten
        copy) before handing them over; `fmt` is ignored.
      - Atomic replacement: writes to a sibling tempfile with fsync, then
        os.replace. A crash at any point leaves either the complete old file
        or the complete new file on disk — never a torn write.
      - Backup: writes `<path>.bak` before replacement (refuses if one
        already exists, to avoid clobbering a prior backup).
      - Audit: appends a record to ~/.agentsweep/audit.jsonl with
        SHA256 of both versions.
